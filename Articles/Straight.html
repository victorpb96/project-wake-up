    <h1 class="bright"><b>What happened to being straight</b></h1>
    <p class="P">Churches are trying to become woke by allowing what was once forbidden in Christian circles, LGBTIQA+. They probably just thought “Hey, why don’t I just let everyone be a Christian at my church and then charge them monthly donations to line my pockets even further, these senior pastors are treating their “non-profit organisation” more and more like a cash generating business to get rich off of by selling Jesus and eternal salvation for the masses. In recent times Christian pastors have even celebrated gay marriages which is interesting because a lot of them think the bible doesn’t agree with the marriage between two people of the same sex. Still, they’re happy to host it in their church and even charge them for an appearance. There’s one thing that separates Christian churches or being a part of Islam and going to the mosque, a Christian pastor will constantly nag you for money, they’ll even print out brochures and put them on your seat listing small to massive $20,000+ donations or even print it on the screen as a constant reminder that you need to donate to the Church. On the other hand, you’ll never encounter being pestered for money if you go to a local mosque, the Imams who run the mosque won’t go around trying to extort ordinary people for a quick buck.

      Islam teaches people not to screw others over for the sake of financial gain, but that’s something Christians don’t seem to want to get into their heads. Churches will take most from those who can’t even afford it claiming the money will come back to them from God because they’ve taken their generosity to the next level by making a big sacrifice and donating large sums of their hard-earned money which ends up in the pockets of these senior pastors so they can splurge on houses and missionary trips all over the world. I’ve encountered some of these people first-hand and always wondered how they’ve managed to get away will extorting others out of hard-earned cash. It has reached a point where there doesn’t seem like an end in sight, but if people wake up and leave the church we can turn the situation around and people can break free from this mass indoctrination and financial domination they’re enduring. I want to see more people spending less time going to church and praying to a man who was a prophet, not God, there’s so much more they could be doing with that lost time, as only Allah can answer your prayers not Jesus, just speaking facts.
