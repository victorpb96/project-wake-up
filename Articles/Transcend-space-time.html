    <p class="P">Heaven is a fictitious place made up by a group of people which then was spread amongst religious groups as an idea that would indoctrinate masses of people to their religion so they could control their lives. I don’t know why there hasn’t been a consensus on this view already, people want to believe anything that secures the future they think will exist for their soul after life, and death passes, so does the soul. Why do all these churches feel the need to suck the life blood out of the general population, taking their money and using to spread lies amongst the public to only make themselves richer in the process. They start by indoctrinting the young so that when they grow up they believe nonsense and it continues to spread like a disease. People find comfort in religion and it doesn’t nessecarily have to be a bad thing when praticed in private, but it doesn’t end there, people have the urge to go out of their way to indoctrinate others, their friends and family, then the rest of the world. It makes me sick to think this is currently happening. Misleading the masses on a global scale at an ever increasing scale. The time is now to act and realise we are being taken for a run for our money and we loose countless hours of our time by listening to bullshit come out of a pastors mouth. The pastors that touch our kids up and indoctrinate, it can’t keep going on.

        The way we can stop that madness is by starting with one person, who stands up and speaks out about the pedofile ridden church, and people who make repentance an excuse to do what ever they want to do and claiming that they are christian. Rules made up by a small few to control the masses, it can’t keep going on, the ones at the top are sick in the head, they claim to be doing gods work, but in reality they’re doing what they want to grow and continue christianity. We need to write more publicly available information for masses to read and absorb and hopefully we can save some people from that bullshit. Because people in the future are going to take that shit too seriously like they already have done in the past like filth they are. More people are going to begin to wake up and realise how indoctrinated they are, why they can’t go out to a bar or pub and have a few beers with mates, because the pastors at the church have told them it’s a sin and you’re going to hell if you continue with that behaviour as a religious person. It’s sick how they set up institutions to brainwash people into thinking they’re going to continue gods work as pastors. 
        
        We’re going to make people wake up and realise they’re wasting their time here on earth their religious nonsense bullshit they practice on a daily basis. A man on a mission to tumble the organised church. You got to push it to the limit our understanding of the world around us and of space time, and what moves inbetween it all which is beyond our sensory perception.
        We have to figure out what logical steps need to be taken to free all the indoctrinated people and save them. All it takes is a man on a mission and a laptop, the internet and a platform to change the world for the better going foward into the future. A bigger better furture without everyone worshipping jesus, that’s a world I and other people want to see, it’s a future that makes sense and is worth living in. when that day comes there will be a big party to celebrate the liberty and freedom of the minds of the masses who have transended relgious bullshit and the people who control that domain out in the world sucking the life out of people.the priest lures people in with his smile and fake charm to preach to them the man written bible which wasn’t written by god.
